Trybixel is a web application that allows users to create pixel art.<br>
The app is designed to provide users with a simple and intuitive interface<br>
for creating pixel art, allowing them to unleash their creativity.
<br>

## **Inspiration**
This project was inspired by the pixel art project from the Web Development course at [TRYBE](https://www.betrybe.com/).<br>
I wanted to take what I learned in the course and apply it to this project. <br>
I hope my project can serve as inspiration for other students and developers who <br>
are in the learning process.
<br>

## **Stack**
1. **HTML** 
2. **CSS** 
3. **Javascript**

<br>

## **Usage**

To use the application, follow the link -> [Trybixel](https://trybixel.vercel.app/).

1. Open the Tribixel app in your web browser.
2. Use the color picker button to select the color you want to use. Click on a pixel to change its color to the selected color.
3. Use the paint bucket button to fill the entire frame with the selected color.
   <br>
   `Note: The paint bucket button changes the color of the frame background, not the individual pixels.`
4. Use the eraser button to remove a single pixel at a time.
   <br>
   `Note: If you use the eraser tool, you will need to select a color again before you can paint.`

5. Use the clear board button to erase all pixels and start over.

<br>

## **Known Bugs:**
#### **Current Work in Progress**
1. If you use the eraser tool and then try to paint again, the paint color will not apply until you select a new color from the color picker. 
<br>

## **Feature in Development:**
1. **Download Drawing**: I'm currently working on adding a feature that allows you to download your pixel drawing as an image file. Once this feature is implemented, you will be able to save and share your creations.
